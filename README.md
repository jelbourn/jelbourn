### Ahoy

I'm Jeremy. I've been a software engineer at Google since 2012 and I'm currently the technical lead for Angular.

I've given [a bunch of talks about Angular over the years](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22jeremy+elbourn%22).

[I read a lot of scfi-fi and fantasy](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7879608-jeremy-elbourn). [I play a game now and then](https://steamcommunity.com/id/jelbourn/).
