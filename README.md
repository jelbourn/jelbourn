### Ahoy

I'm Jeremy. I've been a software engineer at Google since 2012 and I currently work on the Angular team. I ocassionally use my Google 20% time to advance the use of [Sass](https://github.com/sass/sass) inside Google. 

I don't have a website, but I do have a vanity domain for my dog (http://mal.dog). 

I've given [a bunch of talks about building components with Angular](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22jeremy+elbourn%22)

[I read a lot of scfi-fi and fantasy](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7879608-jeremy-elbourn). [I play a game now and then](https://steamcommunity.com/id/jelbourn/).
